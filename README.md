# ClarionJson

Json serializer and parser for Clarion. Fork of code created by Dries Driessen for his RavenDB client.

Check what has changed in [commits](https://github.com/CarlosGtrz/ClarionJson/commits/master).

### Note May 2021

I started modifying Dries Driessen's code on 2013 because there were very few option to process Json files using Clarion back then. I forked his code, made a few fixes, and added the features I needed. 

Around 2015, Capesoft released their commercial product [jFiles](https://capesoft.com/accessories/jFilessp.htm), also a fork of Dries' code, but with a lot of new features.

I haven't yet done a feature by feature comparison of what this code and jFiles do, but I may do that in the future, and I may end changing my code to use jFiles.

So, if you are just starting with Json and Clarion, it may be a better idea to look into jFiles first.
